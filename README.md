# MPTool
MPTool is created with the goal that if you know PowerShell you should pretty easily be able to create management packs. It contains a lot of build-in logic in each function, it automatically adds management pack references if needed, for a PowerShell discovery you only need to create a PowerShell array with the discovery data and the function it self will create the SCOM specific code needed, and so on.

##For detailed documentation see [Wiki](https://github.com/AndreasSobczyk/MPTool/wiki)

Please report if you hit any Bugs or troubles so we can improve where it is needed, also if you have any idea for future releases we will take it in and evaluate.
